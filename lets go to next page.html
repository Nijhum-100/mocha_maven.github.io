      <h1>Well, here comes our freshly baked Dr. Elahi!</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Firstly, congratulations on your incredible achievement! I am sure those six admirers weren't wrong about your potential. Seriously though, juggling two jobs and a PhD is no easy task. You've earned the title of "superhuman."</p>
      <p>I'm incredibly happy for you, Dr. Elahi. I'm proud of you. Not only have you achieved something incredible, but you've also made your Maa, Baba, Nasim vaia, Vabi, and everyone who knows you incredibly proud. Now, put down that dissertation, give your brain a break, kindly don't take any tasks from Work 2 yet, and just let's celebrate!</p>
      <p>I don't know how these 3 months flew. We spent hours talking about everything under the sun, from how corn can be transformed into fuel to how to do social work (!) â€“ didn't think I would enjoy spending so much time with someone, let alone someone who thinks aliens can invade the world. But here we are, still talking, still laughing, and who knows what the future holds.</p>
